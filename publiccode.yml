      return extracted coordinates, depths, and material descriptions as JSON.
    longDescription: >-
      Boreholes Data Extraction is a pipeline to extract structured data from
      borehole profiles in PDF files. Extracted properties (currently
      coordinates, depths and associated material descriptions) are returned in
      JSON format, and (optionally) visualized as PNG images.

      The goal of the project is to automate the extraction of structured data
      from borehole profiles as much as possible and to integrate it with the
      boreholes.swissgeol.ch application (internal use at swisstopo).
    features:
      - Extract borehole coordinates from PDF profiles
      - Extract depth intervals for lithological layers
      - Extract material descriptions as plain text
      - Export results as JSON (predictions.json) and optional PNG visualizations
      - Provide a layer description classification pipeline based on BERT
